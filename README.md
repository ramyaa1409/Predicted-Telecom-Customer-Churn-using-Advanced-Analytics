# Predicted-Telecom-Customer-Churn-using-Advanced-Analytics

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, impacting revenue and
sustainability. This project aims to identify predictors of churn and develop a predictive
framework. Utilizing the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM, with over 7,000 records and
33 features, we conducted comprehensive analysis, including EDA, data preprocessing, and
deploying machine learning models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random
Forest, and XGBoost. Our methodology focused on understanding data patterns, addressing
quality issues, and optimizing models for accuracy, precision, and recall. Factors like contract
length, payment method, and service usage patterns emerged as significant predictors. Random
Forest and XGBoost showed superior performance. This study emphasizes predictive analytics'
value in enhancing customer retention strategies and suggests exploring advanced modeling
techniques for better accuracy and operational applicability in the telecom sector.
